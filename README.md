## Shortest path (Maze)

A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from a source to a destination. In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.

## Introduction

The shortest path problem is one of the most fundamental problems applicable in various fields and has close relation to route navigation systems. This is a technique for multi-criteria optimization. Route guidance helps us in providing the path directions based on changing traffic conditions. A useful routing system should have the capability to support the driver effectively in deciding on an optimum route to his preference. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is suitable for finding not only the shortest route but also better routes. https://elib.npu.edu:2053/docview/1912514872/5FD29CC6AEF5440FPQ/1?accountid=31440

Application of short path

The applications of shortest path computations are too numerous to cite in detail. They include situations in which an actual path is the desired output, such as robot motion planning, highway and power line engineer- ing, and network connection routing. They include problems of scheduling such as critical path computation in PERT charts. https://elib.npu.edu:2053/docview/919156834/F98EAED212E14FA4PQ/5?accountid=31440
